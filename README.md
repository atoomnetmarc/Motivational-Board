Resistors are common 0805.

LEDs are 3528 RGB common anode (CA). Please check if pinout is correct before ordering. The common anode should be on pin 4, the other pins do not matter in which order (RGB, BGR, GBR...) they are. Pin number could be different depending on supplier/manufacturer.

This one has different pin numbering but should fit:
